# Preparations

* Download Version 2 of the data (Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2.json) from:
https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection
* Unpack the data and move it to this folder (the project folder)
* In the following step you will download several python modules,
so preferably you should create a virtual environment by running:
	python3 -m venv env
Activate it either bei running:
	./env/bin/activate
or
	source ./env/bin/activate
(depending on your operating system)
* Now run 'set-up.sh' from this folder
You should now find 3 new folders in this directory ('env', 'csv', 'Data').
In the 'Data' folder you should find following files:
	- Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2_val.json
	- Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2_test.json
	- Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2_train.json
	- Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2.json
